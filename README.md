WordtoVec: A reviews dataset has been used to train the WordtoVector model of Gensim library of python. The dataset has been preprocessed (tokenization, removing stop words etc) using NLTK and Gensim libraries. After the model has been trained, a few test words from the dataset have been selected and their similar words are computed.
